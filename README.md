# ListToPopupAttribute
With this attribute, you can dynamically populate a dropdown list at runtime to show it in the inspector.

Use a scriptable object to store a list of strings and convert it to an enum in the Unity inspector.

To use it just attach EnumListBehaviour.cs to a gameobject, and create in your asset folder a new ScriptableObject by right click => Create/Enum list/New enum list.
